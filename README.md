# Hotel Booking Website Features

This repository outlines the key features for a hotel booking website.

## User Authentication for Login and Registration

- Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register with their personal information and log in with their credentials. Ensure data privacy and security with password encryption and other security measures.

## Booking Room

- Provide a user-friendly interface for customers to search, view, and book hotel rooms. Include various filtering options, such as check-in/check-out dates, room types, and amenities. Allow users to select their preferred payment method for reservation.

## Cancel Booking

- Allow users to manage their bookings by providing a simple process for canceling reservations. Include a clear cancellation policy, and make it easy for users to initiate cancellations while adhering to any cancellation fees or deadlines.

## Add Review of Booked Room

- Enable users to leave reviews and ratings for rooms they have booked, enhancing the website's transparency and credibility. Implement a review system with options to rate various aspects of their stay, such as cleanliness, staff friendliness, and overall experience.

## Dynamic Page Title

- Implement dynamic page titles that change based on the user's interactions with the website. This can improve search engine optimization (SEO) and user experience. For example, dynamically update the title to show the hotel name, location, and specific room details when users view room listings or booking confirmation pages.

These features will enhance the functionality and usability of your hotel booking website, making it more appealing to potential customers and helping them navigate the booking process smoothly.
